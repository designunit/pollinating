## <a name="how"></a> HOW WE ORGANIZED?

![How we organized?](/how-it-works.jpg)


## Structure

For the Green Cities online space to work effectively, the community assigns **community roles** to participants, organizes community events, and uses a **system of rooms in the Green Cities online space**. This system allows participants to conduct work and discussions on specific topics while remaining in a common context.


## Community events

**General SYNCHRO community meetings** are held every week on Thursdays at 18:00 UTC+3 | 19:00 UTC+4. These meetings are open to all members of Green Cities and help synchronize a common perspective on the current context and achievements of Green Cities. The meetings summarize all of the groups' work for the week, discuss and vote on proposals developed in the groups. The meetings are accompanied by simultaneous translation into Russian and Armenian, recorded and posted on youtube.

**Group meetings** are set up by each group. These meetings are open to all Green Cities members and are devoted to working on specific issues relevant to the community and focusing on developing a project for submission to the Green Cities grant. Meetings are held in Russian, Armenian, or English without simultaneous translation, as decided by the group, and recording of the meetings is encouraged.

**Welcome meetings** are held as new Green Cities members arrive. These meetings are open to all Green Cities members and introduce them to the structure and themes of the Green Cities workspace. The meetings help you get oriented so you can contribute to Green Cities.

**Technical team meetings** are private meetings with a **time keeper, documentarian, reporter, interpreter, and moderator** to track the results of the Green Cities collaboration and coordinate to make it accessible and transparent to all participants.


## Community roles 

**Moderator** makes sure that the rules of communication are followed and helps you navigate the room system and find people with the right community roles or events in the Green Cities community.

**Group host** proposes an idea and organizes a public discussion of its development in a series of public meetings (2 or more). The group host is responsible for preparing the meeting agenda and notes.

**Co-facilitator** helps the group host to guide the group and offers the best practical tools in facilitation.

**Time keeper** takes into account the contributions of community members who have received community roles, he takes care of the calendar of community events.

**Knowledge worker** makes sure that the Knowledge Base is updated and that all documents accompanying community meetings are uploaded to the Green Cities repository, and that all links leading to the documents work.

**Interpreter** makes sure that all documents have language translation (Russian-Armenian-English), subtitles, or simultaneous interpretation.

**Reporter** takes care of the weekly news agenda distributed in the community
Host of the welcome meetings is responsible for introducing newcomers to the pollinating.space platform and the online space of Green Cities
